## Installation ⚙️

1.  Make sure you have Python 3.9-3.12 installed.
2.  Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://hebbkx1anhila5yf.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/dsc-main%20%281%29-mZx3gdAdtqzpcwS1f1UW8bP3v40vB8.zip dsc-main
    cd dsc-main
    ```

3.  Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
    ```

## Usage 🚀

1.  Place the `house_cleaned.csv` and `houses.csv` dataset files in the `dsc-main/dataset/` directory.
2.  Run the prediction script:

    ```bash
    python house_price_prediction.py
    ```

    The script will train models (including linear regression and neural networks) on the provided dataset and output the predicted house prices.

## Data Source 📊

The dataset used in this project contains information about house prices and various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location. The data has been preprocessed to handle missing values and clean inconsistencies.

## Model 🧠

This project uses multiple modeling approaches:
- A simple linear regression model from scikit-learn
- Neural network models built with TensorFlow/Keras

These models are trained to predict house prices based on various features in the dataset. Combining traditional statistical methods and deep learning approaches provides a comprehensive analysis of housing price factors.
